title: Wandering Trader Trades
---

We’ve added a number of trades to the Wandering Trader to make sure that every player has a chance to get items that have a limited number in the world. There are plans for other methods in the future, but the wandering trader is an amazing candidate feature all on it’s own!

Each of these trades have a roughly equal chance of occurring in a wandering trader, but our custom trades are less common than the vanilla trades, so you won’t always see them. 
There will be a maximum of 4 custom trades per Wandering Trader, and a relatively high chance for none, so be on the look out!
