Any time you hold a lodestone compass you'll get your current offset from the linked lodestone and if you add a number encased in () then that number will be changed to green when any of the coordinates match it. 

:::tip
ðŸ’¡ It doesnâ€™t matter if the coordinate is positive or negative, it will match the provided number. IE `(10)` will match both `-10` and `10` but `(-10)` wonâ€™t match anything because itâ€™s not considered a number.

<summary>Spectator Mode</summary>
<div>

All players can move between spectator mode and survival mode freely. You can do this by running the `/gms` command to switch to survival mode, `/gmsp` to switch to spectator mode, or `/gmtoggle` to switch to the opposite of your current mode. 
You will always be returned to the last location you were in survival at. This helps prevent players from taking advantage of the ability. Youâ€™ll be notified of the location youâ€™re being returned to when you change to spectator mode and you can check again by running the `/gmreturn` command while in spectator mode.
