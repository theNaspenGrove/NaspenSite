These are Features that you interact with in world that aren’t big enough for their own page.

<summary>Chunk Loading</summary>
<div>

The experimental Vanilla Tweaks Data Pack that loads a chunk when you drop a Nether Star on top of a Lode Stone. 
This will load the chunk that the Lode Stone is in and *only* that chunk. There might be some funkiness with the surrounding chunks and the chunk load level, but that’s for you to sort out in detail :P

The chunk will stay loaded as long as that Lode Stone stays placed. When you break it you will get the Lode Stone and the Nether Star back, so don’t be afraid of trying it out!
