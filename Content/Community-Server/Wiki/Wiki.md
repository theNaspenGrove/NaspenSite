# Community Server Wiki 

Welcome to the Naspen Grove Community Server Wiki!  
You'll find information about the ways the server is run, the changes we've made, and things you may need to do as a player. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [Discord](https://discord.naspen.mov)!
  
If you aren't sure where to start, make sure you check out the [Server Features](/Community-Server/Wiki/Server-Features/) and the [MinecraftAuth Ranks](/Community-Server/Wiki/MinecraftAuth-Ranks) page for what you'll need to join.
