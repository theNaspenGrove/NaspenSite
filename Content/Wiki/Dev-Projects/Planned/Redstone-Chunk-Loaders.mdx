title: Redstone Chunk Loader 
tags: ['Plugin']
---
A plugin the loads chunks for a set amount of time by consuming resources after triggered by a redstone input. 

The chunks would be loaded using [PluginChunkTickets.](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Chunk.html#addPluginChunkTicket(org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin)) 

Not sure if PluginChunkTickets persist across reboots. Need to test.
