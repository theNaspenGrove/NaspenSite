title: Structure Validation API

A Paper API to validate the shape and/or location of structures to trigger an action and/event like adding new blocks to the structure. For example giving the player the ability to summon husk spawners in a desert temple as long as the temple is complete and dug out of the sand. 

- [ ]  Validate structure shape
    - [ ]  Ability to verify just from shape, IE all stair/slab types count as valid
    - [ ]  Ability to say that you need specifically stone, specifically wood, or one of a custom group of blocks
    - [ ]  Ability to define a single block
- [ ]  Validate the structure that the action starts in, if desired

Getting structure at the players’ location, need to learn NMS I guess
