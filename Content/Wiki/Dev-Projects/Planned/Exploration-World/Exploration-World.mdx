title: Exploration World 
---

There are a lot of items in Minecraft that require you to explore or destroy the world to acquire. Most of them fit well into the exploration niche, things like dungeon loot or rare mob drops. I want to make a custom dimension that functions as a type of labyrinth leading between all of the world biomes and structures as well as some custom ones with the ores or smaller structures. 

The idea would be that you could enter the labyrinth using a custom portal or a single server portal using something like the multiverse plugin and once in there you navigate the pathway-esque structures that exist like Mine shafts, end cities, and nether fortresses to find the structures. It would switch between void and terrain, allowing you to also walk over the terrain or fly with an elytra for some distance, but always pushing you back into the pathways/tunnels or for you to dig your own.
