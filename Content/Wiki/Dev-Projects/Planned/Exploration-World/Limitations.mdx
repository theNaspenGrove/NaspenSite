Spigot doesn’t support custom dimensions entirely, so the world can’t be generated on the fly when using spigot or any of it’s forks. Pre-generation would be a must in those cases. 

Biome fog is based on the dimension you’re in, not just the biome. So I wouldn’t be able to recreate the exact look of a biome without using 3 interconnected worlds instead of 1 world with shifting biomes. 3 worlds that you travel between with portals honestly sounds cool, so if I can do it I’ll opt for that. Otherwise the biomes will always look a bit off. 

This world will eventually be depleted too, so it would need to be reset periodically. Ideally with a different seed. That also means that it would need to generate on it’s own and have no hand crafting.
