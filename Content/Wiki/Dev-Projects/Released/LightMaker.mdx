An incredibly simple plugin that allows for the ability to obtain and use the vanilla [Light Block](https://minecraft.wiki/Light_Block) in survival mode. 

- Breaking of the light block can only be done while holding the item, just like when in creative.
- When holding the item and looking at a light block the current level of the block is displayed above the players hotbar.
