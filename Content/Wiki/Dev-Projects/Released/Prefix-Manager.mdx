A tool that allows players to pick their prefix from a predetermined list or create a custom one. 

## Goals

- One command with a GUI interaction for players
- Available prefixes and the Player's current choice are stored as LuckPerms Meta
    - If no prefixes are chosen by the player then the one with highest weight should be displayed (might be tricky tbh)
- Doesn't update the players current prefix when they gain access to a new one
