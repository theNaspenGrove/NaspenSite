A very simple plugin that allows players and auto crafters to "uncraft" shulker boxes into 2 shulker shells and drops any contents they have.  
Now you can store those empty shulkers you don't need anymore, or transport your material boxes more easily when you're done with them. Even better, it works as an alternative to an instant shulker unloader that destroys the shulker!

- Crafting any color of shulker box by itself in a crafting grid will result in 2 shulker shells
 - The chest is lost
 - Any dye used is lost
- Any items inside of the shulker box will be dropped when crafted
 - This is true for both players and auto crafters


:::warning[Could not drop item from shulker box, location is null]

If you see this in your console after uncrafting a shulker box with items in it and the shulker box *didn't* drop it's item, then whatever method you used to uncraft the shulker box didn't provide a location to the craft event!
