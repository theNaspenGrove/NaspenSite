There are a few blocks in the game that aren’t as renewable as I’d like, so I added a few neat ways to get them. 

## Deepslate

Stone and Cobble generators under Y0 will generate deepslate types instead of stone types. 

## Calcite

You can generate calicite in a stone generator by putting a Bone Block under the water when the lava hits it. There’s a 1 in 64 chance that the bone block will be converted to a coal block!

## Tuff

You can turn lava into tuff by exposing it to an explosion from TNT or a creeper!

## Dragon Egg

If you kill the dragon with a block of obsidian on top of the center of the exit portal a new egg will be laid. 

## Gilded Blackstone/Nether Gold Ore

There is a 1 in 2 chance \(50%\) chance for the blackstone or netherrack a piglin is standing on to become “gilded” when they complete a barter. This can be automated by moving the gilded version out from under the piglin and replacing it with an un-gilded version of the block.
