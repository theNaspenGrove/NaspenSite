One of the major non-vanilla features of the server is Item Shifting. This is a custom plugin that allows you to use gold tools and XP to “shift” items to your inventory instead of having them drop on the ground when you break a block. You can also use non-gold tools at the cost of gold nuggets and shift items into a shulker box held in your offhand.
