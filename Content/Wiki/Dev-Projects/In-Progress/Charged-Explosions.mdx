This is a plugin that I "started" working on back in December 2020 that allows charged creepers to break 1 piece of bedrock directly below them. It's been running on my community server since then and amounts to a total of 15 lines of code (excluding lines needed for every spigot plugin and imports). However, since there's a large amount of danger to transporting and controlling charged creepers I've been wanting to add a mechanic that can boost the amount of bedrock they can remove. 

I'm looking at having them use the normal explosion calculator when they explode while falling above the bedrock. That way you get fine control of which piece of bedrock is removed while they're on the ground and can also control how much is removed by changing the height the creeper falls from. 

Doing this would be quite a bit more complicated though, and I need to make sure that it's as reliable as possible since I'm hoping to make it automated for large bedrock removal. I'm keeping a list of what I need to look into, test, or develop below.
