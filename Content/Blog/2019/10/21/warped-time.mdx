Warping moments surround my days  
an hour lost to seconds in haze  
forever lost amidst years of maze  
seconds shatter frame by frame  

{/* truncate */}

A mind frame set against my way  
Moments blistered and burned away  
Hours lost against the backdrop of day  
The second that is now a good midway  

Warping moments all I know  
A time without count to show  
A grid without edges to call home  
A day lost in breaths counted by some  

Worth counted by actions  
Time fights distractions  
Hours uncountable by other matches  
Days defined by steps equated countless
