Sweat these tears of salt  
The result of many years assault  
Burn through bone breathing out  
Everyday a rebound, a renewed bout  
Forever living a fighting scout  

{/* truncate */}

Running towards a daily fight  
Performing at peak a mighty sight  
Defeat the man ahead, break his might  
Leave behind his children to sing of fright  
This is the life for a scout of night  

Stay hidden among the shadow  
A lost fight tonight is pain tomorrow  
A man taken down from behind is saved his sorrow  
Every dead mans face sinking and sallow  
Remorse ends the night, we scouts donâ€™t wallow
