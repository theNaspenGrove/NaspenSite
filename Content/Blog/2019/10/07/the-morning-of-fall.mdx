The very air reeks of rotting stone  
in between tar and decrepit home  
The heat but a memory lost and thrown  
Every breath of wind a has a mind of its own  

{/* truncate */}
  
Watching the sun break the clouds  
Every step pushed back by the slick ground  
Fleeing the world as pinkish light surrounds  
Feeling the sun warm the air and open new sounds  
  
Swirling wind pushes every sense of mine  
A war between body and frame of mind  
The cold defined with the freedom on the line  
Lift me up, carry me worries through time  
  
Shattered leaves and broken branches  
Coated in water all hopeless and senseless  
Their beauty on the ground amongst the fences  
Weighed down by rain awaiting the first fungus  
  
Every breath tastes of the coming ice  
A reminder the world hides its face  
A season apart but still showing grace  
Winters coming, a fearsome race
