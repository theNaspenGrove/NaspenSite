Sunshine on a metal daisy  
A pure form of life gone crazy  
Metallic crystals of insanity  
Structure built and straining  
A shape captured vaguely  
A world its bent on fixing 
{/* truncate */} 
Swirl to the light forever swinging  
A dancer to the suns daytime singing  
Twisting its stem nearly always dizzy  
Sunshine blasting a metal daisy  
Heating the air with fury  
Silky hairs angrily burning  

Petals of shiny metal reaching near  
A fearsome thought held in fear  
The darkness of night a force of willful sheer  
A terror so overwhelming the world steers clear  
The light of day a thought held dear  
Dooming to light all cowards born of fear  
Those who from the sidelines and cheer  
Afternoon light ends right here  
Glinting on a puddle of the manâ€™s shodden tear  

This flower a beauty by which to define pure  
A world in which life needs no cure  
This metal daisy shines as a glistening mirror  
The daisy a monument left to reassure  
The light blinding those without will to endure  
Sunshine glinting from a light bourn of vapor  
The metal daisy a beacon of hope and allure
