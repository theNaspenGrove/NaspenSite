A burning man feels no pain, only fire  
Pain has no meaning to those consumed  
Fated to burn by the shadow lights desire  
A torture of mind with body all but doomed  

{/* truncate */}
  
A burning man fears no land  
His pain is the worst that nears  
Wandering worlds for a helping hand  
Not a thought spared for his mortal fears  
  
The burning man finds a land of water  
A pit of ice welcomes him home  
The cooling touch beckons him further  
Putrid water boils revealing acidic foam  
  
The burning man fears his death  
His helping hand inverted  
Reminding him he had yet to lose his breath  
Acid filled his lungs and body contorted  
  
Our burning man has lost his fire  
The plague of realms a wives tale  
A man lost to senseless desire  
Leaving behind a smoking trail
