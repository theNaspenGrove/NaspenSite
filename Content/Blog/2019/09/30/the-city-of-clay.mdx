The grand scale of such a place  
Echos racing across this vast space  
The empty sound betraying the shape  
Drawn out dry while holding a great face  
Standing tall and proud, facing the great escape  

{/* truncate */}

Each side listening to the void, hearing the steps of all  
Every sound a light shone across these great halls  
Sunbeams unable to make the shadows fall  
Objects hued by distance, color stalled  
Every solid face thrown to turmoil  
  
The city sits still, yet to me its warping  
Every massive pillar a towering reed twisting  
Every building a shape of motion all but missing  
To an untrained ear all is gone, a trick that’s skipping  
The squares become triangles, the world all but warping  
It’s shape unaware of shape, the world is but chaos forming  
  
The wind is a monster  
A most mischievous trickster  
Taking minds with his whistler  
Deafening the unfortunate who hear  
Visions of the world lost screaming louder  
Obnoxious wind, a plight on the land, our sharper
