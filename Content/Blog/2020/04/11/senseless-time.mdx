As time goes by it becomes harder and harder to trust my senses, to know exactly how and why my body reacts to the world. My interpretation changes by the second and some days it’s impossible to keep up. Each sense working on a scale that changes with every new piece of information I gleam from it, a drastically fast kaleidoscope of broken images and feelings. Brighter lights, clearer sounds, sharper temperatures, and a swaying scope of scale attack me constantly, wearing at my view of the world. Each shift defines a whole new set of actions and reactions to reinvent, a constant game of mix and match, find the value, adjust and prefix.

Check my vision, watch for space, rescope distance and speed. Always a broken game, a losing battle against a shattered brain. Skills that wain faster than their use, moments of clarity that set me free. Moments by which my motivation flys, a vision of broken skies and solid ground. The heavens lost, confounded in their great scope, with solid burning ground screaming it’s putrid truth.

## Adjust and prefix

Watch the scale  
A distance around you  
Measure the falling hail  
Shattered parts in view  
Leaving burning trails  
Make your perspective true  
Your center motion rail  
Feel each push pass through  
Moving you by sail  
Shaking you broken and skewed  
Counter actions or fail  
Reaction and survival impromptu  
A new sound prevails  
The world coloured in blue  
Cracking foundations hollow and frail  
Prefix the action in due  
Lest you end with an action designed to fail  
A motion written in the best of truth

## Watch for Space
Hear your dreams  
Become a master of seams  
Find the open lost scenes  
Hidden behind noise that screams  
  
Hear the space  
Watch it race  
Rushing into place  
Ending with a blasting face  
  
Hear it’s words  
Know what they hold  
Waiting for time to scold  
Teaching a lesson of life gone cold  
  
Hear the shatter  
A pattern of broken plaster  
Each its own single splatter  
Tearing through space and matter
