The world reeks of beautiful waste  
Of stories told with volatile taste  
A human mind seeks with haste  
Each source of this rancid trace  

{/* truncate */}

The world reeks of a foul fume  
With anger and venom in bloom  
A scented flower clearing the room  
The aftermath of a race to doom  

My world reeks of a delightful spark  
Each whisper of anger a work of art  
Goosebumps raize the thought apart  
A testament to a god of naught  

My world dreams of senses anew  
A palace where I can enjoy the view  
A structure by which my eyes are true  
My senses become my own to use  
>This is a very heavy poem to me. Through it I show many of the challenges I face interpreting the world through broken, over exaggerated senses while outlining those that still don’t recognize they are fighting with it. With it I hope that people can see that pain in of itself is no measurable thing, and is a fight we must all conquer eventually.  – mov51
