The world shakes  
As the morning wakes  
To a shattered fate  
A mourning mate  

The aftermath of lives past  
Their tortured mind all but ash  
Drawn out over static facts  
A bed of nails and wax  

{/* truncate */}

The missing middle strand  
Ideas echoing so grand  
The voice a masterâ€™s hand  
A trinket from dreamland  

Their missing mental half  
A hold on realities match  
Lost between here and that  
Burning skin touched by facts
