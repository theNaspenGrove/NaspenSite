Find me motion defined  
A motion that shows its mind  
Staying within lines predefined  
Reactions by which life can bind  

{/* truncate */}

Find me a word stuck in time  
That shows meaning through design  
The word a beating heart against a flatline  
Showing itself through a motion defined  

Show me where the world lies  
On the brink of two torn lines  
Lines built on what motion defines  
Motion derived from lidded minds  

Teach me moving truth  
By which our minds find youth  
In tandem our lost bodies move  
Our thinking towards something new  
> Take notice of the moving world around you. By the interactions we and the world around us has, we build the future, just as the present was built by the past. Watch, and learn. The world wants to teach. It has wonders and mysteries in every inconsequential action, areas of study not yet conceived of, and struggles by which millions may die.
