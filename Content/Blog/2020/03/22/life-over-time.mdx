Future defined in shock -- Minds all but lost  
Escaping it’s tiny case -- Defining their own shape  
Defile the world’s own -- flock Man’s folly the final cost  
Energy caught mid race -- Their will of patterns make  

{/* truncate */}

A sweeping ripple -- All a cascading filter  
The true mass effect -- The made lost defect  
Minds defined as simple -- Each their own trickster  
Finding a rhythms catch -- Trapped by what they deflect  

Minds think alike -- Energy moving mind  
Marking time by light -- The fever pitch of life  
The years an open mic -- A companion found in time  
Devoured by motions fight -- Defining futures strife
