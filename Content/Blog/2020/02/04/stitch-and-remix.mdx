Stitch and remix  
Grab reality and affix  
Attached with a masculine grip  
Build the stars as you see fit  
A world built from the seam you split  

Take each step in time  
A momentary peace sign  
Each breath marking the rhyme  
A score for the all encompassing lines  
The ordered rows staying aligned  

{/* truncate */}

Make a feminine task  
A mothers fearsome grasp  
By which a world is clasped  
Through which we all see our past  
The touch of those long passed  

Define the forbidden mark  
By which all men will march  
Holding back the fear so stark  
The edge by which death embarks  
A symbol of men amongst the stars  

You build a world with many parts  
Both power and fear to start  
Your fear in your lack of skillful art  
And having the power to give your heart  
To know you freedom is torn apart  

Behold, world grows beyond you  
It makes its own hold for truth  
Taking steps to deny itâ€™s past youth  
And rid itself of the carrion brutes  
Those who are themselves new
