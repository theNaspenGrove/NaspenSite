Just as darkness fuels despair  
A man lost is well aware  
That he built his binding lair  
And his chains are locked by lack of care  

{/* truncate */}
  
Fueled by fear of change  
He built unyielding chains  
Mentally barred by a willful stain  
His life held back by thoughts so vain  
  
Darkness bred to fight his life  
To bring order to perceived strife  
Choked his mind and sight  
His fear warping wrong and right
