Your broken decrepit minds  
Ancient in all but time  
Burn life away like flies  
While drowning the overburdened skies  

{/* truncate */}
  
A generation of greed  
Left us all their ashes burned from trees  
Bending our systems to fit your need  
Destroying lives to find your keys  
  
Warping the Fortune of all  
With humanities stolen call  
Your lives of squandered wealth  
Only serve to hinder worldwide health  
  
Your desire the source of turmoil  
A hunger for your own rotting stench  
A future fueled by stolen oil  
Destroyed in your desire to quench  
  
Sit there you may  
As the world breaks  
As it falls from your lifeâ€™s decay  
While you sit amid the bloodied lakes  
  
On you lands the blame  
In your hands was the seed  
From your life was built the flame  
That devoured the world in greed
