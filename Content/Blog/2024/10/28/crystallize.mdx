I've been struggling with the idea of who I am for awhile now and it's been a major block in exploring who I *want* to be post-coming out. There are too many parts of me that I faked, never explored, or just refused to understand and distinguishing between them is *painful* to say the least...  
{/* truncate */}
I partially covered this idea in my blog post titled "[My Mr. Hyde](/Blog/2022/09/30/my-mr.-hyde/)", and I want to cover some of the progress I've made since then. 
  
For the most part, I'm still the same to be honest. I haven't been able to do very much experimentation, buy clothes without it being a *problem*, or form a solid idea of "me", **but** I have started to realize a few important things about the process. It's not really about finding the answer before I make a decision, or *knowing* what I want to look like, do, or *be* in the future before I start. It's just about *trying* something because I like it now or have liked it before, then seeing if it sticks long enough for part of me to *crystallize* around it.  

Like, I've been agonizing about the things I spend my time one because I, one, don't have very much of it anymore, and two, don't know who I want to be now that I don't have to be the "me" that's running from "myself". I **know** that's *absolutely stupid* though, because that's not how habits or people develop, but I've spent so many years micromanaging my outward personality that I've been worried about doing it *wrong*. I feel like I'm starting to recognize that emotionally though, so that I can actually start making those choices for what I want to do.  
  
It's an <sub>infinitesimally</sub> small step, but I've been able to working through the things that I actually *enjoy* and just feeling *comfortable* in the moment. Getting back into writing, crafts, and gardening. Finally planning out what I want my long term goals to be...  
There will always be more to do because I'll never stop learning and changing, but I feel like I'm finally making it somewhere close to *permanence* and *stability*.

If things go to plan, I'll be making blog posts about my crafts! I hope to get into making jewelry and clothing, as well as a few minor electronics projects.  
Stay tuned for next week when I'll explain my connection to the rings I wear and my hopes for the ones I'll make!
