I've always struggled with self care. Things as "basic" as showering regularly have been a *constant* issue for as long as I can remember and it's made nearly every other aspect of my life so much harder. Maintaining any kind of routine, feeling comfortable in my skin or clothes, and adjusting to new things are all way harder when you can't shower, brush your teeth, care for your hair, or keep your skin from breaking out without feeling like you're **wrong** for wanting to.

I'm <sub>*\(somewhat\)*</sub> sorry about how wordy this is. It's been awhile and I have a lot to say!

I've had dozens of reasons why it's so hard for me. 
- Sensory Overload 
   - The feeling of going from "dirty" to "clean" is worse than just staying dirty. Especially when it comes with all the noise, water, smells, and heat. 
- Dysphoria 
  - I hate seeing myself as I am, dirty, clean, or otherwise. 
- Over Heating 
  - I can't really tell when the water is too hot, so I often get out of the shower already sweating and massively over heated. 
- Emotional Energy 
  - Self care just sucks, and it takes too much energy to force myself to care. 

They're all varying levels of true, and I've had or tried a bunch of different coping mechanisms to "fix" them since like, *not caring* for myself is a *"problem"*.  
I knew that I could solve the over heating issue by running cold water either at the end of my shower, or periodically while in the shower. Even if I didn't *feel* like I was too hot, I could watch for some of the symptoms and also just cool of before leaving. It made things better, but never quite "solved" it.  
Listening to music that I knew the shape of helped with the sensory overload, and that was an easy one to implement since being alone with my thoughts is *scary*.  
I even **transitioned** to alleviate the dysphoria, but showering and self care was *still* **difficult**. More than I thought it had any right to be when I *wanted* to be clean and like myself.  
<center>I *wanted* to care about and *spend time* on myself.</center>  
  
It wasn't until I moved out last year that it *started* to get easier, and it's taken awhile, and a lot of introspection, to realize why.  
  
I've always felt the need to do something all the time. Like, if I'm doing *anything* there's a thousand strings pulling me to do other *tasks*, or projects, or just *things* that *aren't this*. For the longest time I thought that was just "me", that I was by nature someone who "does things". But after I got sick, and when I wrote my [coming out analogy](/Blog/2021/06/29/enter-stage-left-natalie/) about running away from an alarm, I started to realize that a lot of my drive came simply from a desire to *not sit still*.  
  
Now I was forced sit still to by my condition, and self care became a *requirement* to keep up any kind of output. Yet even with that, it was *difficult*, I still felt *anxious* when taking a shower or just taking the couple of minutes I needed to brush my teeth.  
I wouldn't say that it felt like the time was being wasted, but I was always worried about the time *after* I was done. What I would be doing *next* and if anything would change while I was taking time for myself.  
  
After moving out, I **truly** realized how much of my time was spent simply *reacting* to the chaos of my mom's household. There was never a moment that I wasn't aware that my entire *week* could be changed by the whim of my mom or how she reacted to some "disaster". I had no *control* over my next moments, no ability to plan ahead in any capacity, and no certainty about things I couldn't see or hear.  
  
A couple months ago I realized I'd carried some of that "need to do" anxiety here with me, so I started taking a day entirely to myself after doing it by accident. No time limits, no goals, no work, just *me*. 
<center>I **finally** slowed down and it's so much better then I would have thought.</center>  
  
Not only is all of my time **mine**, but I'm **here**. I'm *in the moment* and not fearing being pulled away or having to reschedule my entire week because we have to do some spur of the moment cleaning that's been being put off for a decade.  
I never would have thought about it, but that's why I hated self care. The time I spent on it could *never* be consistent, and it was always at the discretion of the chaos. I've finally been enjoying taking showers, and there's no stopping now.
