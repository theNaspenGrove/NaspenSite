Dilute our words as generations pass,  
Forget the moments those words were meant to capture,  
The years they shared between us.  

Dilute the meaning of our phrases and twist them as we did,  
to serve the same pain.  
Forget the changes the world has wrought,  
and the way it changes your words.  

{/* truncate */}

Dilute the pain we suffered to say those words,  
Forget the beauty you now see as a result,  
and the way it skews your own pain.  

Dilute our words as generations pass,  
and the way you use them.  
Forget the fear the once carried,  
you now bring them fear of your own.
