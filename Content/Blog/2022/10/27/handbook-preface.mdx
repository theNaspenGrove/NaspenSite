The following entries have been translated and reconstructed from a signal of unknown origin or direction. 

We as The Archivists have made efforts to remove any of our guesswork on what these entries mean or where they are coming from, and have focused solely on making out what they say. If we are unable to discern the meaning behind a section it will be marked or noted, and when we have the ability to correct the missing information we will do so. New entries may, and have so far, give us new information about what we've already translated and the old translations will be adjusted only to correct translations or missing information.
