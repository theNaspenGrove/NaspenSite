## A Mandate's Handbook
### Chapter 5: The Ascension


One of the inevitable facts of being a \*\*\* is that you will eventually \*\*\* enough \*\*\* to ascend. Despite the generous wording, most of us want to avoid leaving our life behind and fight against it for as long as we can. We don't know where it is that we Ascend too, but something pulls the \*\*\* us there and it seems like we can never come back. Many have promised to return or communicate and we have never heard from them again. **Always remember that there is no coming back from Ascension!**

#### The Pull

The Precursor to Ascension has been called "The Pull" because those who experience it feel as though they are being pulled violently inward at an increasing strength in step with the intensity of their \*\*\*. These pulls come in attacks or waves depending on how close an individual is to Ascending and are the final warning sign you'll get before needing to \*\*\*. If you do not \*\*\* in time you will Ascend, and there is **no known way of predicting how long that will take from the first attack or wave.**

#### Avoidance

At some point every \*\*\* will have to face this, Mandate or \*\*\*, and the only way to fight it is to separate your \*\*\* into new \*\*\* in order to decrease the pull. The process by which we avoid Ascending is the antitheses of \*\*\*, the process by which we amass the \*\*\* that seems to be the target of the pull of the Ascension. The process itself will be covered in a later chapter, but it's important to note here nonetheless. 

#### Aftermath

\*\*\* can still be called upon after they Ascend, and any \*\*\*. **This is the only reason we know of in which this process differs from death.** Their power still exists somewhere, and can act on our world, but they have no ability to do it of their own accord.
