I host a Semi-Vanilla Minecraft server for my Supporters and Community members that can be joined by following me on Twitch or YouTube, as well as through the other methods mentioned [here](https://wiki.naspen.mov/MinecraftAuth-Ranks-fef6368ad58f41658a2b6819336ae0f3) on my wiki. The server is whitelisted using [MinecraftAuth](https://minecraftauth.me/) and requires on of the aforementioned ranks to be able to join, as well as your presence in my [Discord Server](discord.naspen.mov).  
  
There are a number of features that I've added to the server, and that feature list grows continually. You can find an up-to-date list of what's been added to the server [on the wiki](https://wiki.naspen.mov/Server-Features-1b40981e97ca458694d21be95c38e295). 

:::note[join us!]

You can join the server at `play.naspen.mov`!

## Rules

These are the rules every player, including staff, is expected to follow when they play on the server. For the most part it’s fairly simple, just don’t be a jerk. But I’ll lay out the guidelines and expectations just so that everyone’s on the same page.  
  
:::warning

If you feel like you have been punished unjustly, contact **staff@naspen.mov**. Reaching out through any other means about your punishment will result in an immediate entail of any potential appeal and possible escalation.

<details>
<summary>All rules are up to staff discretion</summary>
<div>

Situations can get complicated, fast. So it’s up to our staff to try and sort through what’s going on and make the decision they think is best. This is a Minecraft server and not a government, you are not owed any explanation as to why a decision was made. The staff member may explain the decision if they want to, but they are in no way required to.

<summary>All General Rules apply</summary>
<div>

All rules listed in the General Rules page apply in open Game chat, Private In-Game messages, and any other form of standard or non-standard communication in-game. 

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Containers in public areas are public unless otherwise marked</summary>
<div>

Any container left in a public area is free to take items from or store items in unless it’s marked otherwise. If a container is in a player’s base then it is by default private. Public areas would be places like spawn, the market \(outside of stalls\), or public farms.

<details>
<summary>Ask before pvping someone.</summary>
<div>

Pvp is on all the time. So make sure you make sure the other player wants to fight before you attack them. If anyone dies they won’t lose their inventory or XP but it can still be annoying. If you don’t ask them first you’ll likely get in trouble for it. 

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Remember that other players exist</summary>
<div>

This isn’t an extensive list, but I will update it as needed. However, most of what I expect players to do is to realize that there are other people trying to have fun here. If you’re unsure if what you’re doing is going to infringe on someone else’s enjoyment, then you should probably ask if it’s okay with them that you do it.

Things like building close to their base, copying their stall design block for block, creating a running joke about them being \(Insert awkwardly bad thing here\), etc. These things can be fun, but make sure it’s fun for everyone.
