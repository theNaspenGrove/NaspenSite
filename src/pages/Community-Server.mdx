I host a Semi-Vanilla Minecraft server for my Supporters and Community members that can be joined by following me on Twitch or YouTube, as well as through the other methods mentioned [here](https://wiki.naspen.mov/MinecraftAuth-Ranks-fef6368ad58f41658a2b6819336ae0f3) on my wiki. The server is whitelisted using [MinecraftAuth](https://minecraftauth.me/) and requires on of the aforementioned ranks to be able to join, as well as your presence in my [Discord Server](discord.naspen.mov).  
  
There are a number of features that I've added to the server, and that feature list grows continually. You can find an up-to-date list of what's been added to the server [on the wiki](https://wiki.naspen.mov/Server-Features-1b40981e97ca458694d21be95c38e295). 

:::note[join us!]

You can join the server at `play.naspen.mov`!
